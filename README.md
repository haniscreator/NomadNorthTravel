## 💡 Inspiration

The app is inspired by the idea of digital nomad travel in Northern Thailand — peaceful mountains, rich culture, and eco-tourism experiences.

## ✅ Credit
I got some design inspiration and reference ideas from those videos, but I took a different approach in structuring the widgets.
